# Gotta catch 'em all!

Safe bird trap for research.

These are the images from the 3D model, based on the Yunick trap design for parakeets.

The green box is for the IR sensor and battery.

The blue box is for the actuator.  Once it's activated the door will fall to trap the birds.

The DIY remote control mechanism (by Tania Molina):

PARTS NEEDED:

Receiver & Relay 12VDC Module (IR or RF signal can be used)

Transmitter Control (separate)

Solenoid 4.5V

12V Battery A23

Battery holder

The Fritzing Sketch can be used as a guide, just replace 9V with 12V battery, even if it works with 9V ('cause it does!), and working
with the module everything else is easier, because it already has the relay and the signal receiver in it, then you'll just
have to press a button to activate it. Modules are not in the Fritzing world, so I had to use separated components.

I apologize for bad gif quality.
